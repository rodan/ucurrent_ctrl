an overkill MSP430F5510 based project that controls the power delivery to Dave's uCurrent.

if you forget to turn off the uCurrent you will find the enclosed 2032 Li cell completely flat the next day.
this project provides a timeout feature to the uCurrent. a push-button is used to start up both this circuit and the uCurrent.
multiple presses will either reset the timeout counter or increase the timeout period.
the initial timeout period can be optionally modified via a 3V serial uart.
also in case the output voltage is low enough for a given period the uCurrent is turned off.

uC pinout:
 - P1.1  IN  digital - push button trigger
 - P1.4  OUT digital - power-latch my circuit
 - P1.5  OUT digital - enable power delivery to the uCurrent
 - P2.0  OUT digital - blinky
 - P6.0  IN  analog  - battery voltage
 - P4.1  IO          - SDA (i2c for ADS1110)
 - P4.2  IO          - SCL

connectors:
 - external power - either 3V Li Cell or 3.7V LiPo/Li-ion (MOLEX 0530470210)
 - push button    - optional external push button tied to the case (MOLEX 0530470210)
 - ucurrent power - uCurrent connections (MOLEX 0530470210)
 - debug          - TI spy-bi-wire interface and serial uart for programming, debug and user input (MOLEX 0530470610)

power:
 - the uCurrent has the cell unpopulated and the power switch set to the "ON" position.
 - this circuit will provide the 3V needed to the uCurent
